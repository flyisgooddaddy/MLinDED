        "abstract": "In the era of Industry 4.0, Additive Manufacturing (AM), particularly metal AM, has emerged as a significant contributor due to its innovative and cost-effective approach to fabricate highly intricate geometries. Despite its potential, this industry still lacks real-time capable process monitoring algorithms. Recent advancements in this field suggest that Melt Pool (MP) signatures during the fabrication process contain crucial information about process dynamics and quality. To obtain this information, various sensory approaches, such as high-speed cameras-based vision modules are employed for online fabrication monitoring. However, many conventional in-depth analyses still cannot process all the recorded data simultaneously. Although conventional Image Processing (ImP) solutions provide a targeted tunable approach, they pose a trade-off between convergence certainty and convergence speed. As a result, conventional methods are not suitable for a dynamically changing application like MP monitoring. Therefore, this article proposes the implementation of a Tunable Deep Image Processing (TDIP) method to address the data-rich monitoring needs in real-time. The proposed model is first trained to replicate an ImP algorithm with tunable features and methodology. The TDIP model is then further improved to account for MP geometries and fabrication quality based on the vision input and process parameters. The TDIP model achieved over 94% estimation accuracy with more than 96% R2 score for quality, geometry, and MP signature estimation and isolation. The TDIP model can process 500 images per second, while conventional methods taking a few minutes per image. This significant processing time reduction enables the integration of vision-based monitoring in real-time for processes and quality estimation.",

        "abstract": "In order to address the high throughput data generation challenges in the directed energy deposition (DED) process development, a design of experiments (DOE) informed deep learning (DL) model is developed for modeling of laser powder-based DED process. A small-size experimental dataset is obtained according to DOE, by which a large-size dataset is augmented via the DOE regression model and then used to pre-train the DL model. A subset of experimental data is employed to fine-tune the DL model. The presently developed DOE-informed DL model is validated via single-track deposition of stainless steel 316L, in which the cross-section dilution shape (including depth) and the geometrical characteristics of beads, including the width, height, area, and wetting angle are predicted accurately. The prediction of the porosity and hardness are acceptable for single-track deposition, since variations of both the experimental porosity (from 0.04\u00a0% to 0.30\u00a0%) and hardness (from 168 HV to 182 HV) are quite small for the single-track deposition, especially predicted ranges for the porosity (from 0.05\u00a0% to 0.25\u00a0%) and hardness (from 170 HV to 180 HV) are the subset of the experimental results. The DOE-informed DL model developed in this study is based on a single-track deposition dataset; in future work, the DOE-informed DL model will be extended to multi-layer deposition.",

Most of the AM processes are likely to have pre-programmed and fixed optimized process parameters for materials whereas DED machines comes with flexibility. The process parameters, such as laser power, scanning speed, energy density and layer height, play a great deal in controlling and affecting the properties of DED fabricated parts. Therefore, it is required to identify the beneficial process parameters and their effects on the print quality for a particular output and material in DED process.

        "abstract": "This thesis focuses on developing predictive models using machine learning techniques to forecast the tensile behaviors of 316 stainless steel parts fabricated through the Laser Directed Energy Deposition (L-DED) process. The primary aim is to bridge the gap between process parameters and resulting material properties without extensive experimental testing. Two main machine learning algorithms, XGBoost and Ridge Regression, were utilized to predict ultimate tensile strength and yield strength based on process parameters such as laser power, scanning speed, and powder feed rate. The models were trained using a dataset obtained from a series of controlled experiments designed to cover a wide range of process conditions. The predictive performance was enhanced by employing techniques like cross-validation and bootstrap aggregation to ensure robustness and reliability of the model predictions. The findings from this research are expected to help in optimizing the L-DED process by predicting the mechanical properties of produced parts, thus reducing the need for physical testing and increasing manufacturing efficiency.",

One of the challenges is the time-consuming development of thermally stable process conditions for the production of defect-free components. The presented approach aims for extracting all relevant machine-, process- and result parameters from different sources, using an algorithm to merge the heterogeneous data streams and to stabilize and optimize the process through machine learning algorithms. To provide qualified training data an expert system is presented to facilitate the identification of causal relationships by domain experts.

        "abstract": "Many strategic industrial sectors prefer Directed Energy Deposition (DED) to other Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies due to the high material deposition and build rates. However, the inadvertent formation of defects such as porosity, micro-cracks and microstructure anomalies hinders its adoption in industries that require specific mechanical and microstructural properties. These defects are caused by undesirable fluctuations in process conditions such as material flow rate, laser power, melt pool dynamics, environment gas composition, temperature gradients. This research proposes in situ quality monitoring of DED using images of process zone and contrastive learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experiments included deposition of titanium powder (Cp-Ti, grade 1) with the particle size ranging between 45 and 106\u00a0\u03bcm on the base plate (99.6\u00a0% Ti6Al4V grade 1), forming a cube geometry. The process parameters were tuned to achieve six quality grades. The video of the process zone was recorded co-axially to the laser beam during the entire manufacturing, which was eventually used as the input to train CNN's based on contrastive losses. An in situ monitoring strategy for classifying the different quality grades was demonstrated in a supervised and semi-supervised manner, with an accuracy ranging between 89\u00a0% and 97\u00a0%. The performance of the developed framework was compared to an alternative clustering technique, namely t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding, justifying the efficiency of our approach. The developed methodology demonstrates the possibility to track workpiece manufacturing quality using simple CCD cameras with minimum interventions on the commercial machines.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising solution for real-time monitoring of the quality of additively manufactured (AM) metallic parts. This study focuses on the Laser-based Directed Energy Deposition (L-DED) process and utilizes embedded vision systems to capture critical melt pool characteristics for continuous monitoring. Two self-learning frameworks based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformer architecture are applied to process zone images from different DED process regimes, enabling in-situ monitoring without ground truth information. The evaluation is based on a dataset of process zone images obtained during the deposition of titanium powder (Cp-Ti, grade 1), forming a cube geometry using four laser regimes. By training and evaluating the Deep Learning (DL) algorithms using a co-axially mounted Charged Couple Device (CCD) camera within the process zone, the down-sampled representations of process zone images are effectively used with conventional classifiers for L-DED process monitoring. The high classification accuracies achieved validate the feasibility and efficacy of self-learning strategies in real-time quality assessment of AM. This study highlights the potential of AI-based monitoring systems and self-learning algorithms in quantifying the quality of AM metallic parts during fabrication. The integration of embedded vision systems and self-learning algorithms presents a novel contribution, particularly in the context of the L-DED process. The findings open avenues for further research and development in AM process monitoring, emphasizing the importance of self-supervised in situ monitoring techniques in ensuring part quality during fabrication.",

        "abstract": "Direct Energy Deposition (DED) is an additive manufacturing technology that allows for both the realization of complex shape objects and for repairing of damaged or worn metallic components. A high-power laser beam melts the substrate and the metallic powder particles ejected by nozzles converging to the same spot. The laser beam spans the substrate surface, creating overlapping solid tracks and thus building up parts in a layer-wise fashion. Despite fine parameters optimization, the process instability may lead to layer height variations that, accumulating over time, could affect the stand-off distance, i.e., the optimal printing distance between the nozzles and the substrate. Getting far from optimal stand-off, where the laser beam and the powder flow are focused, impairs the printed part quality, especially from a geometrical point of view. In the present work, an innovative process monitoring approach has been investigated. Sensors such as a pyrometer and RGB camera have been integrated into a DED machine, to measure the radiation emitted by the melted material at different spectral bandwidths. Since variations in stand-off distance affect the signals acquired, a neural network approach has been derived to estimate the stand-off of the deposition at each layer and highlight possible anomalous situations. The training dataset has been acquired by printing tracks at different stand-offs. The proposed solution has been validated by comparing the stand-off estimated on defective multilayer parts with the measurements provided by a high-resolution 3D scanner. Preliminary results show that the proposed method is a promising approach to prevent critical stand-off deviations.",
